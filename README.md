#### Description
  This is a code-along application I built while following [codedamn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJUmE61LxhbhudzUugHL2wQ)'s tutorial on YouTube. Check him out.
  
#### Setup
  Set up a [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) application, copy the configuration and put it into the `app.module.ts` file, then start your chat.

#### Run
  To run, navigate to the project directory on your terminal and run `ionic serve` to start.
